    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Careless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging. Here are some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don't forget that most list methods modify the argument and return None. This is the opposite of the string methods, which return a new string and leave the original alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you are used to writing string code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `word = word.strip()`\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is tempting to write list code like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `t = t.sort()  # WRONG!`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Because `sort` returns `None`, the next operation you perform with t is likely to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Before using list methods and operators, you should read the documentation carefully and then test them in interactive mode. The methods and operators that lists share with other sequences (like strings) are documented at [https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods). The methods and operators that only apply to mutable sequences are documented at [https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pick an idiom and stick with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do things. For example, to remove an element from a list, you can use pop, remove, del, or even a slice assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To add an element, you can use the append method or the + operator. But don't forget that these are right:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    t.append(x)\n",
    "    t = t + [x]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    And these are wrong:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    t.append([x])    # WRONG!\n",
    "    t = t.append(x)  # WRONG!\n",
    "    t + [x]          # WRONG!\n",
    "    t = t + x        # WRONG!\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Try out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure you understand what they do. Notice that only the last one causes a runtime error; the other three are legal, but they do the wrong thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make copies to avoid aliasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you want to use a method like `sort` that modifies the argument, but you need to keep the original list as well, you can make a copy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    orig = t[:]\n",
    "    t.sort()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example you could also use the built-in function sorted, which returns a new, sorted list and leaves the original alone. But in that case you should avoid using sorted as a variable name!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Lists, `split`, and files\n",
    "\n",
    "    When we read and parse files, there are many opportunities to encounter input that can crash our program so it is a good idea to revisit the guardian pattern when it comes writing programs that read through a file and look for a \"needle in the haystack\".\n",

    "    Since we are breaking this line into words, we could dispense with the use of `startswith` and simply look at the first word of the line to determine if we are interested in the line at all. We can use `continue` to skip lines that don't have \"From\" as the first word as follows:\n",

    "        print(words[2])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This looks much simpler and we don't even need to do the `rstrip` to remove the newline at the end of the file. But is it better?\n",

    "    ```\n",

    "\n",

The best place to add the `print` statement is right before the line where the program failed and print out the data that seems to be causing the failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now this approach may generate a lot of lines of output, but at least you will immediately have some clue as to the problem at hand. So we add a print of the variable `words` right before line five. We even add a prefix \"Debug:\" to the line so we can keep our regular output separate from our debug output.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    First we commented out the debug print statement instead of removing it, in case our modification fails and we need to debug again. Then we added a guardian statement that checks to see if we have zero words, and if so, we use continue to skip to the next line in the file.\n",
