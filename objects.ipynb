    "At the beginning of this book, we came up with four basic programming patterns which we use to construct programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sequential code\n",
    "- Conditional code (if statements)\n",
    "- Repetitive code (loops)\n",
    "- Store and reuse (functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "In later chapters, we explored simple variables as well as collection data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we build programs, we design data structures and write code to manipulate those data structures. There are many ways to write programs and by now, you probably have written some programs that are \"not so elegant\" and other programs that are \"more elegant\". Even though your programs may be small, you are starting to see how there is a bit of \"art\" and \"aesthetic\" to writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As programs get to be millions of lines long, it becomes increasingly important to write code that is easy to understand. If you are working on a million line program, you can never keep the entire program in your mind at the same time. So we need ways to break the program into multiple smaller pieces so to solve a problem, fix a bug, or add a new feature we have less to look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, object oriented programming is a way to arrange your code so that you can zoom into 500 lines of the code, and understand it while ignoring the other 999,500 lines of code for the moment."

    "The first line constructs a `list` object. When Python creates the list object, it calls the *constructor* method (named `__init__`) to set up the internal data attributes that will be used to store the list data. Due to encapsulation we neither need to know, nor need to care about these in internal data attributes are arranged.\n",

    "We are not passing any parameters to the *constructor* and when the constructor returns, we use the variable `stuff` to point to the returned instance of the `list` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second and third lines are calling the `append` method with one parameter to add a new item at the end of the list by updating the attributes within `stuff`. Then in the fourth line, we call the `sort` method with no parameters to sort the data within the stuff object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we print out the first item in the list using the square brackets which are a shortcut to calling the `__getitem__` method within the `stuff` *object*. And this is equivalent to calling the `__getitem__` method in the `list` *class* passing the stuff object in as the first parameter and the position we are looking for as the second parameter.\n",

    "### attribute\n",
    "A variable that is part of a class. \n",

    "### class\n",
    "A template that can be used to construct an object. Defines the attributes and methods that will make up the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "### child class\n",
    "A new class created when a parent class is extended. The child class inherits all of the attributes and methods of the parent class. \n",
    "\n",
    "### constructor\n",
    "An optional specially named method (`__init__`) that is called at the moment when a class is being used to construct an object. Usually this is used to set up initial values for the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "### destructor\n",
    "An optional specially named method (`__del__`) that is called at the moment just before an object is destroyed. Destructors are rarely used. \n",
    "\n",
    "### inheritance\n",
    "When we create a new class (child) by extending an existing class (parent). The child class has all the attributes and methods of the parent class plus additional attributes and methods defined by the child class. \n",

    "### method\n",
    "A function that is contained within a class and the objects that are constructed from the class. Some object-oriented patterns use 'message' instead of 'method' to describe this concept. \n",
