    "## Why functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There are several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read, understand, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the rest of the book, often we will use a function definition to explain a concept. Part of the skill of creating and using functions is to have a function properly capture an idea such as \"find the smallest value in a list of values\". Later we will show you code that finds the smallest in a list of values and we will present it to you as a function named `min` which takes a list of values as its argument and returns the smallest value in the list."

    "If you are using a text editor to write your scripts, you might run into problems with spaces and tabs. The best way to avoid these problems is to use spaces exclusively (no tabs). Most text editors that know about Python do this by default, but some don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabs and spaces are usually invisible, which makes them hard to debug, so try to find an editor that manages indentation for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, don't forget to save your program before you run it. Some development environments do this automatically, but some don't. In that case, the program you are looking at in the text editor is not the same as the program you are running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging can take a long time if you keep running the same incorrect program over and over!\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that the code you are looking at is the code you are running. If you're not sure, put something like `print(\"hello\")` at the beginning of the program and run it again. If you don't see `hello`, you're not running the right program!"
